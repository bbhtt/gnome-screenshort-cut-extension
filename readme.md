# screenshort-cut-gnome-extension

A simple shortcut to take screenshots directly on your top bar!

## Disclaimer

Since GNOME 42, it's necessary to enable Unsafe Mode to perform method calls via the D-Bus interface. This extension will automatically enable it to call the native screenshot UI. Use at your own risk.
